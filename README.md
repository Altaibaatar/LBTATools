## Description
Do you suffer from ugly layout code and boring UICollectionViewController boilerplate code?  Yes, we've all been there. I'm not the only one that has written view setup functions that are so monstrous that it feels like a **beast from hell**.  

Now, there is a solution to this problem: **LBTATools**.

There are two main problems I want to tackle here:

1. Use UIStackView to layout everything, but reduce overall code.
2. Create quick vertical and horizontal lists, but skip the boring cell registration, numItemsForSection, cellForItemAt code.



```swift

```



## Installation

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is an easy to use dependency manager . To install LBTATools simply add the following line to your Podfile:
